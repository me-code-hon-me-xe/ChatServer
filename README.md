## Introduction

Hello everyone, this is my project of **Chat Server Application**. This is a lightweight, real-time messaging platform designed to facilitate communication between users. Built using the ZK framework and JDBC for database interactions, this application allows users to chat with each other, manage their accounts, and receive real-time notifications for incoming messages.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages in real-time, with instant updates to the chat view.
- **Notifications**: Notifications are displayed when a new message is received, ensuring that users never miss a message.
- **User Authentication**: A secure login system ensures that only authenticated users can access the chat functionality.
- **SQLite Database**: The chat data is stored locally using SQLite, with JDBC handling the database operations.
- **ZK Framework**: The application uses the ZK framework for the frontend, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **ZK Framework**: For building the user interface.
- **JDBC**: For database operations and connecting to SQLite.
- **SQLite**: As the database for storing user and message data.
- **Java**: The primary programming language used in the project.
